# AutoHAS
PyTorch implementation of AutoHAS

## How to use

Main logic is implemented in `train_controller.py`, which can be run like any Python script with `python train_controller.py`

Don't forget to `pip install -e .`!

Might be a few extra requirements in `requirements.txt` but I'll sort those out later
